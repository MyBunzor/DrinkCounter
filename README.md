# DrinksDrunk

In this app, users will be able to keep track of their drinks during a night out. The user can plus different sorts of drinks, inputting
data when having another one. This can be done on the homescreen, that looks like the activity on the left:

The stored data can be seen when the user clicks on 'DATA'. The timeperiod in which the data can be shown, can also be chosen by the user. This happens in the choose-activity that's displayed on the right.

When clicking on one of the periods, a graph is shown in which the data for the chosen timeperiod is presented. The plus button 
in the bottomright corner leads the user back to the homescreen.

The app is useful to get more aware of alcoholconsumption, to stop drinking even, or simply to keep track of the amount of drinks
drunk.
