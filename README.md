# DrinksDrunk

Forgetting how many beers you had last night: it happens easily and can be annoying. In this app, users will easily be able to keep track of their drinks drunk during a night out. The user can plus different sorts of drinks, inputting data when having another one. This can be done on the homescreen, that looks like the activity on the left:

The stored data can be seen when the user clicks on 'DATA', upon which the user is led to the activity on the right. Here, the timeperiod in which the data can be shown, can also be chosen by the user.

When clicking on one of the periods, a graph is shown in which the data for the chosen timeperiod is presented. The plus button 
in the bottomright corner leads the user back to the homescreen.

The app is useful to get more aware of alcoholconsumption, helpful when trying to steer clear of booze, or simply to keep track of the amount of drinks drunk.
