# DrinkCounter

In this app, users will be able to keep track of their drinks during a night out. The user can plus different sorts of drinks, inputting
data when having another one. This can be done one the homescreen, that looks like this:

The stored data can be seen when the user clicks on 'DATA'. The timeperiod in which the data can be shown, can also be chosen by the user. This happens in the choose-activity, that looks something like this:

When clicking on one of the periods, a graph is shown in which the data for the chosen timeperiod is presented. The plus button 
in the bottomright corner leads the user back to the homescreen.
